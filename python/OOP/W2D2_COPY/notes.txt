-Start by talking about the assignment that were going to be covering and why we want to associate classes together give a brief over view of everything 
-Start with changing the class slightly add is_active and total_points and take out age also alter team to start as none explain that this will later be where we store the team object that is associated to a given player 
- Write display player info and test out the constructor also write play game function that displays a f string with the player name how many pts scored and min played and increases their total_points by the pts scored 

- QUESTIONS

- Create the team class also use this as an oppoturnity to modularize the code keep it clean and easier to read 
- write display team info get help from the class 
- create a few instances of teams 
- make sure to talk about the roster empty list on team class and the team on the player class 
- associate the two classes demonstrate both ways, affecting the class attribute directly and doing through a instance method 
- transition back to the 3rd problem on the original assignment write the classmethod add_players to Player class talk about cls how its pretty much just self or Player 

- QUESTIONS

- go through add_to_roster in Team class explain what your doing
